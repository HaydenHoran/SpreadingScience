    Helping impoverished youth, and schools, explore the wonders of experimental science and engineering.
    </h1>
    We are committed to one ideal, and one ideal alone: Every person has a right to science, just as they have a right to life and
    liberty.
  
    <h2 class="heading"> Why are we here?</h2>

    <p>
   The founders of this organization come from a relatively impoverished city and attended a high school that had a weak science program.
   When attending college for a degree in engineering, they realized just how far behind they were- in both academics and research experience-
   in comparison to those that grew up with wealth. The stress of playing "catch-up" was unrelenting and monumental.
    </p>
    <p>
   We are an organization designed to lessen, if not eradicate, this disparity of scientific experience and knowledge. Join us
   and join the crusade to expose young minds to the amazing world of experimental science and engineering.
