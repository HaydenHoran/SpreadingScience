   The founders of this organization come from a relatively impoverished 
   city and attended a high school that had a weak science program. When
   attending college for a degree in engineering, they realized just how 
   far behind they were- in both academics and research experience- in 
   comparison to those that grew up in a more affluent environment. The stress
   of playing "catch-up" was unrelenting and monumental.

   We are an organization designed to lessen, if not eradicate, this disparity
   of scientific experience and knowledge.     We are committed to one ideal, and one ideal alone: Every person has a right to science, just as they have a right to life and
    liberty. Join us and join the crusade to expose disadvantaged young minds to the amazing world of experimental science and engineering.
