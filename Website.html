    Helping impoverished youth, and schools, explore the wonders of experimental science and engineering.
    </h1>
    We are committed to one ideal, and one ideal alone: Every person has a right to science, just as they have a right to life and
    liberty.
  
    <h2 class="heading"> Why are we here?</h2>

    <p id="Right">
   The founders of this organization come from a relatively impoverished <br>
   city and attended a high school that had a weak science program. When <br>
   attending college for a degree in engineering, they realized just how <br>
   far behind they were- in both academics and research experience- in <br>
   comparison to those that grew in a more affluent environment. The stress<br>
   of playing "catch-up" was unrelenting and monumental.
    </p>
    <p id="Left">
   We are an organization designed to lessen, if not eradicate, this disparity<br>
   of scientific experience and knowledge. Join us and join the crusade to expose <br>
   young minds to the amazing world of experimental science and engineering.
