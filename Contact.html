    Helping impoverished youth, and schools, explore the wonders of experimental science and engineering.

    We are committed to one ideal, and one ideal alone: Every person has a right to science, just as they have a right to life and
    liberty.

    <h2 class="heading"> Why are we here?</h2>
    
    <p>
   The founders of this organization come from a relatively impoverished 
   city and attended a high school that had a weak science program. When
   attending college for a degree in engineering, they realized just how 
   far behind they were- in both academics and research experience- in 
   comparison to those that grew up in a more affluent environment. The stress
   of playing "catch-up" was unrelenting and monumental.
